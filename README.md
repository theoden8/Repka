## Program

This is a simple TBS 2D strategy game vaguely resembling the rock-paper-scissors. Each of the players has a headquarters and money, which they use for destroying the opponents base.

This game is still very raw (although very funny when you launch it) and can not yet compete with more advanced stuff like noughs&crosses etc.

## Tools

* c++ compiler
* glut
* cmake

## Usage

To compile the program, execute:

    ./link
    ./compile

Or alternatively:

    cmake .
    make

To run the program, use:

    ./_repka
