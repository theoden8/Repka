## Program

This is a simple TBS 2D strategy game vaguely resembling the rock-paper-scissors. Each of the players has a headquarters and money, which they use for destroying the opponents base.

I called it "Repka" as it looks very village-like, so somehow it reminds me of the fairy tale "The Great Turnip" (which is "Repka" in Russian).

This game is still very raw (although very funny when you launch it) and can not yet compete with more advanced stuff like noughs&crosses etc.

## Tools

* GLUT/OpenGL
* CMake

## Usage

To compile the program, execute:

    ./link
